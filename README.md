To download SimpleWeb as an apk file, you need to install the version.zip from the releases. Then when it downloads you can use apps such as Zarchiver or your local files app to extract the archive and when it's done just run the apk file by tapping it and give it the right permissions. And voila, you got yourself your SimpleWeb.
